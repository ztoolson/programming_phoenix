Notes as I am reading

The Lay of the Land
===================

This of each web server as a function
  input: URL (request)
  output: response
^^ do you even functional bro?

Simple Functions
----------------

Somehow the browser establishes a connection.
connection |> phoenix

"In Phoenix, the connection is the whole universe of things we need to know about a user's request"
  -> It represented using an elixir struct


The API of _every layer of Phoenix_ looks like function calls with the first argument of those function calls the connection.

The Layers of Phoenix
---------------------

connection
|> endpoint
|> router
|> pipelines
|> controller

From the controller:
  connection
  |> controller
  |> common_services (implemented with plug)
  |> action

  Example controller:
  connection
  |> find_user
  |> view
  |> template

In Phoenix, whenver its possible, we try to limit side effects, those functions that touch and possible change the outside work, to the controller. This may require a change in thought about the model layer, since you will want to seperate code that acutally calls another web server or fetches code from a database, from the code that processes that data.

Process data through the model, read/write data through the controller.


Hello World
-----------

`mix pheonix.new` => rails new
iex -S mix phoenix.server => rails console

Phoenix Convention!!
  External Data is unsafe, so in controllers match using the string keys, while internally to phoenix match using atoms.

_reponse_ is not the return value of a function, a response is just one more action on the connection.
conn |> ... |> render_response
  
lib/hello.endpoint.ex => This file contains a chain of functions (or plugs) that happen at the beginngin of every request.
  connection
  |> Plug.Static.call
  |> Plug.RequestId.call
  |> Plug.Logger.call
  |> Plug.Parsers.call
  |> Plug.MethodOverride.call
  |> Plug.Head.call
  |> Plug.Session.call
  |> Hello.Router.call (this is where the request is then routed to a controller action)

An endpoint == plug.
Your application is just a series of plugs (functions) beginning with an endpoint and ending with a controller.

The Router Flow
---------------

made up of:
  1. Pipelines
  2. Route Table

connection
|> endpoint (functions for every request)
|> router 
|> pipeline (connection goes through a named pipeline which will have common functions for each major type of request)
|> controller (controller will fetch info from the model and render a template through a view)

Follow the request for GET /hello

connection               # Plug.Conn
|> endpoint              # lib/hello/endpoint.ex
|> browser               # web/router.ex
|> HelloController.world # web/controllers/hello_controller.ex
|> HelloVIew.render(     # web/views/hello_view.ex
    "world.html")        #  web/templates/hello/world.html.eex

> Weâ€™d encourage you instead to stop, and take a look at exactly what happens for each request, from top to bottom.
